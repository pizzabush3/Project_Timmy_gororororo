3. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
side length of hexagons on turtle shell, and side lengths of the circle/ovals for the turtle body/head

4. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
yes, the turtle shell hexagons, and the arms/legs

5. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
the head, the shell, the  limbs, the tail

6. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?
7. the fins and hexagons
